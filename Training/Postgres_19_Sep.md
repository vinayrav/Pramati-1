## **Queries:**
```
1.  SELECT b.name as  Mgr_Name,count(a.name) as Emp_count FROM employee a, employee b WHERE b.emp_id = a.mgr_id and a.joining_date>'01-01-2013' group by b.name order by b.name;

2. SELECT b.name AS "Mgr_Name",min(a.salary) AS "Emp_salary" FROM employee a, employee b WHERE b.emp_id = a.mgr_id and  b.joining_date>'01-01-2013' group by b.name;

3. 2 types to display manager name and count 

 *  SELECT b.name as  Mgr_Name,count(a.name) as Emp_count FROM employee a, employee b WHERE b.emp_id = a.mgr_id and a.joining_date>'01-01-2013' group by b.name  having count(a.name) >=2;
 *  SELECT b.name as  Mgr_Name FROM employee a, employee b WHERE b.emp_id = a.mgr_id and  a.joining_date>'01-01-2013' group by b.name  having count(a.name) >=2;

4. select d.name,count(e.name) from employee e,dept d  where d.dept_id=e.dept_id and e.joining_date>'01-01-2013' group by d.name;

5. select d.name,min(a.salary) from employee a,employee b,dept d  where d.dept_id=a.dept_id and d.dept_id=b.dept_id and b.emp_id=a.mgr_id and  b.joining_date>'01-01-2013' group by d.name;

6.  select d.name,count(e.name) from employee e,dept d  where d.dept_id=e.dept_id and e.joining_date>'01-01-2013' group by d.name having count(e.name)>=2;

7. select extract(year from joining_date) ,count(emp_id) from employee group by extract(year from joining_date);

8. select extract(year from e.joining_date) ,d.name,count(e.emp_id) from employee e,dept d where e.dept_id=d.dept_id group by extract(year from e.joining_date),d.name order by d.name;

9. select extract(year from joining_date) as YEAR,extract(month from joining_date) as Month ,count(emp_id) as Count from employee group by extract(year from joining_date),extract(month from joining_date) having count(emp_id)>2;


10. select m.name from employee e,employee m,dept d where e.mgr_id=m.emp_id and e.dept_id=d.dept_id group by m.name having count(distinct d.name)>1;

11. select d.name,count(distinct m.name) from employee e,employee m,dept d where e.mgr_id=m.emp_id and m.dept_id=d.dept_id group by d.name having count(distinct m.name)>=2;

12. select a.name employee from employee a,employee b where b.emp_id=a.mgr_id and a.joining_date>'01-01-2013'and (select count(a.name) from employee a,employee b where b.emp_id = a.mgr_id )>2;

13. 
 SELECT generate_series(
                  (SELECT MIN(dept_id) 
                   FROM dept),
                  (SELECT MAX(dept_id) 
                   FROM dept)) 
AS MissingID 
EXCEPT SELECT dept_id 
FROM dept ORDER BY MissingID ;


14. Manager Name, Reportee who joined first (Reportee Name - doj), Reportee who draws less sal (Reportee Name - salary)
SELECT a.name,a.doj AS "Reportee Name - doj",b.sal AS "Reportee Name - salary"
FROM
(SELECT b.name,CONCAT(a.name,'-',a.joining_date) AS doj 
         FROM employee a,employee b
         WHERE b.emp_id=a.mgr_id 
         AND EXISTS(
           SELECT 1
           FROM employee a_inr
           WHERE a_inr.mgr_id=b.emp_id
           HAVING min(a_inr.joining_date)=a.joining_date
          ) 
) a
INNER JOIN (
SELECT b.name,CONCAT(a.name,'-',a.salary) AS sal	
         FROM employee a,employee b
         WHERE b.emp_id=a.mgr_id
         AND EXISTS(
             SELECT 1
             FROM employee a_inr
             WHERE a_inr.mgr_id=b.emp_id
             HAVING min(a_inr.salary)=a.salary
              
           )
)b
ON a.name=b.name;


15) Question 3:
* Fiddle: sqlfiddle.com/#!4/ffc645
* Same phase information is duplicated in consecutive days given table phase_data. Write a SQL to fetch the phase duration where same phase in consecutive days to be merged into a single row
phase       start_date   end_date
Phase_0        2010-03-17     2010-03-27
Phase_1        2010-03-27     2010-05-11
Phase_0        2010-05-11

salary_history
id,name,start_date,end_date,salary
1,Aneesh,2010,2011,1000
1,Aneesh,2011,2012,1100--1,Aneesh,2011,2014,1100
1,Aneesh,2014,2015,1200
1,Aneesh,2015,null,1200

INSERT INTO salary_history 
VALUES( 1,'Aneesh',

16) Find the list of employee records where salary data is missing
With the above example, we donâ€™t have salary information from 2012 to 2014

Assume, if above data is as commented, then there is no missing as there is no gap
