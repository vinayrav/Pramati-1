## **Postgres_SET_3:**


1. SQL to find the missing ids from dep

* With generate_series function

```
SELECT generate_series(
                  (SELECT MIN(dept_id) 
                   FROM dept),
                  (SELECT MAX(dept_id) 
                   FROM dept)) 
AS MissingID 
EXCEPT SELECT dept_id 
FROM dept ORDER BY MissingID ;
```


```
Select
	*
FROM
	generate_series (
		(SELECT MIN(dept_id) FROM dept),
		(SELECT MAX(dept_id) FROM dept)
	) AS sn
LEFT JOIN dept ON dept.dept_id = sn
where dept_id is null
```




* Without generate series function

```

DO $$
BEGIN
   FOR i IN (SELECT MIN(dept_id) FROM dept)..(SELECT MAX(dept_id) FROM dept) LOOP
 insert into miss values (i);
   END LOOP;
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


```
```

WITH RECURSIVE series AS (
	SELECT
		1 AS rn
	UNION ALL
		SELECT
			rn + 1 AS rn
		FROM
			series
		WHERE
			rn < 10
) SELECT
	*
FROM
	series

```

2. Manager Name, Reportee who joined first (Reportee Name - doj), Reportee who draws less sal (Reportee Name - salary)

* Without Window Function
```
SELECT a.name,a.doj AS "Reportee Name - doj",b.sal AS "Reportee Name - salary"
FROM
(SELECT b.name,CONCAT(a.name,'-',a.joining_date) AS doj 
         FROM employee a,employee b
         WHERE b.emp_id=a.mgr_id 
         AND EXISTS(
           SELECT 1
           FROM employee a_inr
           WHERE a_inr.mgr_id=b.emp_id
           HAVING min(a_inr.joining_date)=a.joining_date
          ) 
) a
INNER JOIN (
SELECT b.name,CONCAT(a.name,'-',a.salary) AS sal	
         FROM employee a,employee b
         WHERE b.emp_id=a.mgr_id
         AND EXISTS(
             SELECT 1
             FROM employee a_inr
             WHERE a_inr.mgr_id=b.emp_id
             HAVING min(a_inr.salary)=a.salary
              
           )
)b
ON a.name=b.name;

```
* With Window Fucntion
```
SSELECT DISTINCT
	M . NAME AS mgr_name,
	FIRST_VALUE (e. NAME) OVER (
		PARTITION BY M .emp_id
		ORDER BY
			e.joining_date
	) AS first_emp_name,
	FIRST_VALUE (e.joining_date) OVER (
		PARTITION BY M .emp_id
		ORDER BY
			e.joining_date
	) AS first_doj,
	FIRST_VALUE (e. NAME) OVER (
		PARTITION BY M .emp_id
		ORDER BY
			e.salary
	) AS least_sal_emp_name,
	FIRST_VALUE (e.salary) OVER (
		PARTITION BY M .emp_id
		ORDER BY
			e.salary
	) AS least_salary
FROM
	employee e
INNER JOIN employee M ON e.mgr_id = M .emp_id

```      


3. salary_history
id,name,start_date,end_date,salary
1,Aneesh,2010,2011,1000
1,Aneesh,2011,2012,1100--1,Aneesh,2011,2014,1100
1,Aneesh,2014,2015,1200
1,Aneesh,2015,null,1200

Find the list of employee records WHERE salary data is missing
With the above example, we donâ€™t have salary information FROM 2012 to 2014

Assume, if above data is as commented, then there is no missing as there is no gap

* Without Window Function.

```
select * from (
SELECT
	sh.start_date,
	sh.end_date,
	LEAD (start_date, 1) OVER (ORDER BY start_date) AS next_start_date
FROM
	sh
ORDER BY
	start_date)t where next_start_date-end_date > 0

```
