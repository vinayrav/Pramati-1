## **Postgres_SET_3:**


1. SQL to find the missing ids from dep
```
SELECT generate_series(
                  (SELECT MIN(dept_id) 
                   FROM dept),
                  (SELECT MAX(dept_id) 
                   FROM dept)) 
AS MissingID 
EXCEPT SELECT dept_id 
FROM dept ORDER BY MissingID ;
```





2. Manager Name, Reportee who joined first (Reportee Name - doj), Reportee who draws less sal (Reportee Name - salary)

* Without Window Function
```
SELECT a.name,a.doj AS "Reportee Name - doj",b.sal AS "Reportee Name - salary"
FROM
(SELECT b.name,CONCAT(a.name,'-',a.joining_date) AS doj 
         FROM employee a,employee b
         WHERE b.emp_id=a.mgr_id 
         AND EXISTS(
           SELECT 1
           FROM employee a_inr
           WHERE a_inr.mgr_id=b.emp_id
           HAVING min(a_inr.joining_date)=a.joining_date
          ) 
) a
INNER JOIN (
SELECT b.name,CONCAT(a.name,'-',a.salary) AS sal	
         FROM employee a,employee b
         WHERE b.emp_id=a.mgr_id
         AND EXISTS(
             SELECT 1
             FROM employee a_inr
             WHERE a_inr.mgr_id=b.emp_id
             HAVING min(a_inr.salary)=a.salary
              
           )
)b
ON a.name=b.name;

```
* With Window Fucntion
```
SELECT m1.Manager_name,m1.jd,m2.sd
FROM(
    SELECT DISTINCT m2.name AS Manager_name,FIRST_VALUE(CONCAT(m1.name,'-',m1.joining_date)) OVER(PARTITION BY m1.mgr_id ORDER BY     m1.joining_date) 
   AS jd
   FROM employee m1, employee m2
   WHERE m2.emp_id=m1.mgr_id)m1
   INNER JOIN(
              SELECT DISTINCT m2.name AS Manager_name,FIRST_VALUE(CONCAT(m1.name,'-',m1.salary)) OVER (PARTITION BY m1.mgr_id ORDER BY m1.salary) AS sd 
              FROM employee m1, employee m2
              WHERE m2.emp_id=m1.mgr_id)m2
              ON m1.Manager_name=m2.Manager_name;

```      


3. salary_history
id,name,start_date,end_date,salary
1,Aneesh,2010,2011,1000
1,Aneesh,2011,2012,1100--1,Aneesh,2011,2014,1100
1,Aneesh,2014,2015,1200
1,Aneesh,2015,null,1200

Find the list of employee records WHERE salary data is missing
With the above example, we donâ€™t have salary information FROM 2012 to 2014

Assume, if above data is as commented, then there is no missing as there is no gap

* Without Window Function.

```
SELECT CONCAT(a.i,'-',b.i) AS Missing_Data
FROM
(
SELECT i 
FROM generate_series(
                   (SELECT MIN(start_date) 
                   FROM sh),
                   (SELECT MAX(start_date) 
                   FROM sh)) AS t(i)
WHERE NOT EXISTS(
                 SELECT 1 
                 FROM sh
                 WHERE sh.start_date=t.i)
) a

INNER JOIN (
SELECT i 
FROM generate_series(
                   (SELECT MIN(end_date) 
                   FROM sh),
                   (SELECT MAX(end_date) 
                   FROM sh)) AS t(i)
WHERE NOT EXISTS(
                 SELECT 1 
                 FROM sh
                 WHERE sh.end_date=t.i)
)b

ON  b.i-a.i>1;

```
